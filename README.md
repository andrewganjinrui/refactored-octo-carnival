# Determination of hemagglutinin in influenza vaccine quality detection

The basic principle is to measure the diameter of diffusion ring of accine to further know its quality, which is largely relies on 
the concentration. The linear model regarding concentration with respect to diameter of diffusion ring is trained by a large number of 
samples. According to the trained linear model, we can predict the quality of unknow vaccine sample.

The software is developed under VS2010, based on MFC for interface design; and needs
the library for the OpenCV2.4.3
